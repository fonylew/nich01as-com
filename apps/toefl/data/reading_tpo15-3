AWarm-Blooded Turtle
<p><span class="question-1 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>When it comes to physiology, the leatherback turtle is, in some ways,more like a reptilian whale than a turtle<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> It swims farther into the cold of the northern and southern oceans than any other sea turtle, and it deals with the chilly waters in a way unique among reptiles<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="question-2 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>A warm-blooded turtle may seem to be a contradiction in terms<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Nonetheless, an adult leatherback can maintain a body tem perature ofbetween 25 and 26°C (77 - 79°F)in seawate rthat is only 8°C (46<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span>4°F)<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span>Accomplishing this <span class="question-highlight-2">feat</span> requires adaptations both to generate heat in the turtle' s body and to keep it from escaping into the surrounding waters<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span>Leatherbacks apparently do not generate internal heat the way we do, or the way birds do, as a by-product of cellular metabolism<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> A leatherback may be able to pick up some body heat by basking at the surface; its dark, almost black body color may help it to absorb solar radiation<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> However, most of its internal heat comes from the action of its muscles<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="question-3 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three different ways<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> The first,and simplest, is size<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> The bigger the animal is, the lower as surface to-volum e ratio; for every ounce of body mass, there is proportionately less surface through which heat can escape<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> An adult leatherback is twice the size of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will therefore take longer to cool off<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Maintaining a high body temperature through sheer <span class="question-highlight-3">bulk</span> is called gigantotherrny<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> It works for elephants, for whales, and, perhaps, it worked for many of the larger dinosaurs<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> It apparently works, in a smaller way, for some other sea turtles<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Large loggerhead and green turtles can maintain their body temperature at a degree or two above that of the surrounding water, and gigantothermy is probably the way they do a<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Muscular activity helps, too, and an actively swimming green turtle may be T C (12<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span>6° F) warmer than the waters it</p>

<p><span class="question-4 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Gigantothermy, though, would not be enough to keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> It is not enough for whales, which supplement it with a thick layer of insulating blubber (fat)<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="question-5 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Leatherbacks do not have blubber, but they do have a reptilian equivalent: thick, oil-saturated skin, with a layer of fibrous, fatty tissue just beneath a<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Insulation protects the leatherback everywhere but on its head and flippers<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Because the flippers are com paratively thin and blade like, they are the one part of the leatherback that is likely to become chilled<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> There is not much that the turtle can do about this without compromising the aerodynamic shape of the flipper<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> The problem is that as blood flows through the turtle's flippers, it risks losing enough heat to lower the animal's central body temperature when (it] returns<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> The solution is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the turtle's body<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> The leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the blood vessels in the base of as flipper into a countercurrent exchange system <span class="question-highlight-5">.</span></p>
<p><span class=" paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>In a countercurrent exchange system , the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels; thus, the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the flipper itself<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span>This is the same arrangement found in an old-fashioned steam radiator, in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water courses through them <span class="question-highlight-5">.</span>The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement; gulls have a countercurrent exchange in their legs<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> That is why a gull can stand on an ice floe without freezing<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span></p>
<p><span class=" paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>All this applies, of course, only to an adult leatherback<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Hatchlings are simply too small to conserve body heat, even with insulation and countercurrent exchange systems<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> We do not know how old, or how large, a leatherback has to be before it can switch from a cold-blooded to a warm-blooded mode of life<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Leatherbacks reach their immense size in a much shorter time than it takes other sea turtles to grow<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span> Perhaps their rush to adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm<span class="question-highlight-5">.</span></p>
