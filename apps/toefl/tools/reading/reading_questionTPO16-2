○Elements were chemically most similar to those just before and after them in the order.


3. In paragraph 2, what is the author's purpose in presenting the information about the decision by Meyer and Mendeleyev to leave gaps in the periodic table?
○To illustrate their confidence that the organizing principles of the periodic table would govern the occurrence of all chemical elements

○To support the idea that they were unwilling to place new elements in the periodic table
○To indicate how they handled their disagreement about where to place new elements


4. What reason does the author provide for the claim that Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer?

○Mendeleyev assumed that some information believed to be true about the elements was incorrect.
○Mendeleyev argued that Meyer had not left enough gaps in the periodic table.
○Mendeleyev realized that elements were not ordered by atomic mass in the periodic table.


5. According to paragraph 2, why did Mendeleyev suggest changing the atomic mass of indium?
○Because indium did not fit into the periodic table in the place predicted by its atomic mass
○Because there was experimental evidence that the atomic mass that had been assigned to indium was incorrect
○Because there was an empty space between cadmium and tin in the periodic table
○Because the chemical properties of indium were similar to those of arsenic and selenium


6. It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that tellurium comes before iodine in the periodic table even though tellurium's atomic mass is slightly greater because

9. Paragraph 3 suggests that Mendeleyev predicted the properties of eka-aluminum on the basis of
○the atomic mass of aluminum
○the position of the gap in the periodic table that eka-aluminum was predicted to fill
○the similarity of eka-aluminum to the other five missing elements
○observation of the properties of gallium


10. It can be inferred from paragraph 3 that the significance of the discovery of gallium was that it supported which of the following?
○The idea that aluminum was correctly placed in the periodic table
○Mendeleyev's prediction that eka-silicon would be discovered next
○The organizing principle of the periodic table
○The idea that unknown elements existed


11. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.
○Ramsay found evidence of helium in the spectrum of sunlight before he discovered that the element was also contained in natural gas deposits on Earth.
○Ramsay thought he had discovered a new element present in natural gas deposits, but he was wrong since that element had been previously observed elsewhere on Earth.
○After Ramsay had discovered a new element, called helium, in natural gas deposits on Earth, he also found evidence of its presence in the Sun.
○Ramsay later discovered that helium, an element that was already known to be present in the Sun, was also present in natural gas deposits on Earth.


12. The word postulated in the passage is closest in meaning to
○hypothesized
○discovered
○reported

13. Look at the four squares [■] that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.
It was a natural Idea to break up the series of elements at the points where the sequence of chemical groups to which the elements belonged began to repeat itself.
Where would the sentence best fit?


14. Directions: An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below. Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage. This question is worth 2 points.
The periodic table introduced by Meyer and Mendeleyev was the forerunner of the modern table of elements.
Answer Choices
○ Lord Rayleigh provided evidence that the structure of the I—Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh challenged the importance of the periodic table limited the potential number of elements.
○ Chemical research that Henry Cavendish had done a centuryearlier.
○ Isotopes of a given element have exactly the same physical properties, but their chemical properties are slightly different.
○ Mendeleyev and Meyer organized the known elements into a F chart that revealed periodic recurrences of chemical and physical properties.
○ Mendeleyev's successful prediction of the properties of then- r unknown elements lent support to the acceptance of the periodic law.
○In the 1890's, Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh isolated argon and proposed the existence of a new series of elements.
