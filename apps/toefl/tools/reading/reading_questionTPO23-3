○ Late nineteenth century studies of Aboriginal rock art railed to recognize that a variety of styles existed.
○ The extreme age of the earliest Aboriginal rock art has been established but the interpretation of rock art images is still debated.

○ In determining the way in which Australian rock art was organized, archaeologists have made little distinction between geometric and figurative elements.
○ Older examples of rock art consist of simple, repeated geometric patterns while later rock art includes figures and animals.
○ Aboriginal informants were able to explain the meanings of ancient rock art symbols.

This question is worth 2 points.
Water enters, remains, and eventually leaves a lake in a variety of ways.
○
○By measuring the water quantities at each of a lake's inputs and outputs, it can be determined whether water enters the lake mainly from surface or groundwater sources.
○Changes in lake level and volume are caused principally by the amount of evaporation of water into the atmosphere.
○It is sometimes possible to decide whether a lake is surface water dominated or seepage dominated by simple observation at different seasons.
○The average period of time that molecules of water spend in a lake—the residence time—varies from lake to lake and overtime within a particular lake.
○The residence times of surface-water-dominated lakes are usually longer than those of seepage-dominated lakes.
○The residence time of a lake frequently depends on the kinds of organisms to be found in the lake.
